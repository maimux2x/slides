### The first time I had a proper conversation with the participants at the social gathering.

___

<!-- header: Encouraged to attend the event -->

- At the Rails Girls event, I met many female engineers who have built long careers, including **Emori san**(@emorima).

- While there are few women engineers at the company level, I realized that at the community level, I could connect with many experienced female engineers.


- It was the first time I spoke with **Shioi-san** at this event.
  - Spoke with me very kindly, and that made me really happy.

At this event, I talked about my experience of struggling with programming.

It was one of the highlights for me when later on, some people who remembered my presentation reached out to me in the Ruby community.

At that time, I was about to graduate from a Fjord Boot Camp and should have been busy, but for some reason, I found myself saying, 'I'll do it...  :p

- At first, I was working on it together with goh san.

- It was a great learning experience to exchange reviews for the first time on a PR with someone outside of FBC.

Until then, I had always been on the receiving end, getting inspired by the Ruby community.

But at that moment, by chance, I experienced what it was like to make an impact myself.

After the LT, I was approached by the organizer of a Rails Girls workshop in Osaka and a representative from the company providing the venue.

### This conversation prompted me to reflect on my involvement with Rails Girls.

___

<style scoped>
  header {
    display: none;
  }
</style>

I was able to work hard on translating the Rails Girls guide, Because

<br>

- Tanks to the immense support from the Ruby community.<br>

- My own experience of struggling with learning Ruby on Rails motivated me.
  - Rails Girls guide outlines the steps for beginners to familiarize themselves with programming.

Until I participated in the Rails Girls Gathering Japan 2022 event, I didn't know about the existence of Rails Girls.

I thought there might be many women interested in programming who are in the same situation.

___

</style>

When I applied to give a lightning talk at Osaka RubyKaigi 03, I was actually planning to present on a topic unrelated to Rails Girls.

However, after receiving a message from Fjord Boot Camp's mentor, Ito san, I decided to focus on translating the Rails Girls guide as my presentation topic.

If I hadn't received that message, there's a good chance I wouldn't have presented in Osaka, and I might not have considered becoming a Rails Girls organizer either q:
